# ⚙️ DC Motor Speed Control using PID (C-programming)

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a **DC motor speed control system** using a **PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) controller** implemented in C.
It demonstrates how feedback control is used in embedded systems to achieve stable and accurate motor speed.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The motor model simulates speed based on input voltage.
2. PID controller calculates control signal:

   ```
   error = setpoint - actual_speed
   ```
3. Anti-windup prevents integral saturation.
4. Control signal is limited (similar to PWM in embedded systems).
5. Motor speed updates iteratively.
6. Data is stored in `output.csv` for visualization.

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Compile C Code

```id="o0rj9p"
gcc main.c motor.c pid.c -o motor
```

### 2. Run Simulation

```id="4q6jkh"
./motor
```

This generates:

```id="pmf3cc"
output.csv
```

## 📈 Visualization

### Install Python Library

```id="tn0v4r"
pip install matplotlib
```

### Run Plot Script

```id="v6d8i9"
python plot.py
```

This generates and displays the graph (`graph.png`).

## 🔧 PID Parameters

```id="kjr6zq"
Kp = 2.0
Ki = 0.5
Kd = 1.0
```

These values can be tuned to observe different system behaviors.
